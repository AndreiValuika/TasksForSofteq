You can see in result of 'Task4Check' programm work, every solution "step by step" includes 
exactly N*M jumps (where N - number of white mouses and M - number of black mouses) and N+M shifts.

P.S. The Task4Chek program was created ONLY to explain and prove the formula.
It uses an algorithm that is not optimized in terms of time and resources. It makes useless views, but not actions
